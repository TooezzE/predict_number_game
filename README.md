# My data_science project

### Project description
Write a program that guesses the number guessed by the computer in the least number of attempts

**Competition rules**
- Computer guesses int number from 1 to 100 and we need to create program which predict this number
- Algorithm predicting depending on is number less or more than required

**Quality metric**
Results are assessed by the average number of attempts out of 1000 repetitions
